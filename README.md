# Testing for selection in California Scrub Jays in response to novel West Nile Virus
Scripts used in data analysis of potential rapid evolution of *Aphelocoma californica* in response to the West Nile Virus (WNV) introduction to North America.

This study uses a time-series genomic approach to compare the genetic variation of the *A. californica* population between two time points prior to and after the introduciton of WNV.

The bioinformatic pipeline follows that outlined in the `Genomics-Main` submodule.
